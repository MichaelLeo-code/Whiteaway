## First of all, add two major pipelines
### [ ] Orders
  - [ ] write SQL statements
  - [ ] create backend endpoints
  - [ ] create according fetch function
  - [ ] visualize
    - [ ] open new tab 
    - [ ] change type of chartand render it

### [ ] Revenue
  - [ ] write SQL statements
  - [ ] create backend endpoints
  - [ ] create according fetch function
  - [ ] visualize
    - [ ] open new tab 
    - [ ] change type of chartand render it

### [ ] Backend routing is AWFUL, fix

### Minor fixes:
- [ ] frontend sends multiple request at a time
---
### Prev issues I don't have time to fix:
- migrations don't work
