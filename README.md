# Whiteaway Skill test
---
Hey, Rasmus!
Thank you for reviewing my project.
What can I say? I'm proud of the work I've done!

### Let's have a quick overlook:
- Database made with PostgreSQL
- Backend made with TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, typeorm
- Frontend made with JavaScript, Axios HTTP, Chart.js, Bootstrap

Although it's been specified that there's no need to implement all the features, and focus on the code instead... I really wanted to do the best I can. So I implemented them all, but, as always, there is space for improvment.

The main inaccuracy with the assignment given is how I show the data of all months by default, not the last one. That's because of the approach I'm using - showing the sums of data for each month. So, if you choose to look at a single month only, you would see a single bar only in the whole chart, which didn't make many sense.
How this could be fixed? Higher detail of received data, e.g. if you look at 1-2 months of data, backend could detect that and it would make more sense to send a daily data then.

You can take a look at the TODO.md to briefly look at what else might be done with this project.
Especially testing. I thought I'm going to spare some time on it, but I have always been finding some more important features to do.
The testing of this project was conducted mostly manually, except Postman collection requests. I simply didn't manage to do proper testing.

But I'm happy of my planning - my plan was to learn TS on Thursday, make backend on Friday, make frontend on Saturday, and Sunday was left for finishing up. And that's exactly how it went. 

Down there will be a quick demo video:
