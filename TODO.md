  - [ ✓ ] create backend endpoints
  - [ ✓ ] create according fetch function
  - [ ✓ ] visualize
    - [ ✓ ] open new tab 
    - [ ✓ ] change type of chartand render it
  - [  ] time frames

### [ ] Revenue
  - [ ✓ ] write SQL statements
  - [ ✓ ] create backend endpoints
  - [ ] create according fetch function
  - [ ] visualize
    - [ ] open new tab
